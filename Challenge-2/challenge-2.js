// Exercise 1: Array Methods

// Task 1: Create an array of numbers and use the forEach method to log each number to the console.

// Task 2: Create an array of strings and use the map method to create a new array with the lengths of the strings.

// Task 3: Create an array of objects with 'name' and 'age' properties. Use the filter method to create a new array containing only people with an age greater than 30.

// Task 4: Create an array of numbers and use the reduce method to find the sum of all the numbers in the array.

// Task 5: Create an array of strings and use the join method to concatenate them into a single string separated by a comma.

// Sample data for Exercise 1
const numberArray = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const stringArray = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "date"];
const peopleArray = [
  { name: "Alice", age: 25 },
  { name: "Bob", age: 35 },
  { name: "Charlie", age: 45 },
];

// Exercise 2: More Array Methods

// Task 1: Create an array of numbers and use the some method to check if there are any even numbers in the array.

// Task 2: Create an array of strings and use the every method to check if all strings have a length greater than 3.

// Task 3: Create an array of numbers and use the sort method to sort them in descending order.

// Task 4: Create an array of objects with 'name' and 'age' properties. Use the find method to find the first person with an age of 35.

// Task 5: Create an array of numbers and use the slice method to create a new array that contains the second and third elements.

// Sample data for Exercise 2
const evenNumberArray = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10];
const longStringArray = ["elephant", "giraffe", "kangaroo", "rhinoceros"];
const descendingSortArray = [5, 12, 8, 21, 14];
const peopleArray2 = [
  { name: "Alice", age: 25 },
  { name: "Bob", age: 35 },
  { name: "Charlie", age: 45 },
];

// You can now write the code for each exercise based on the provided comments and tasks.
