// Exercise 1: Chaining Array Methods

// Task 1: Create an array of numbers and use a chain of array methods to filter out all even numbers, square the remaining numbers, and then find the sum of the squared values.

// Task 2: Create an array of objects with 'name' and 'age' properties. Use a chain of array methods to filter out people younger than 30, then map the remaining objects to an array containing only their names.

// Task 3: Create an array of strings and use a chain of array methods to filter out strings containing the letter 'a', convert the remaining strings to uppercase, and join them into a single string separated by a space.

// Task 4: Create an array of numbers and use a chain of array methods to sort them in ascending order and then find the product of the two smallest numbers.

// Task 5: Create an array of objects with 'name' and 'score' properties. Use a chain of array methods to find the average score of all people with a score greater than 80.

// Sample data for Exercise 3
const numberArray2 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10];
const peopleArray3 = [
  { name: "Alice", age: 25 },
  { name: "Bob", age: 35 },
  { name: "Charlie", age: 45 },
  { name: "David", age: 29 },
  { name: "Eva", age: 55 },
];
const stringArray2 = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "date"];
const numberArray3 = [7, 4, 12, 2, 8, 21, 14];
const scoreArray = [
  { name: "Alex", score: 92 },
  { name: "Beth", score: 78 },
  { name: "Chris", score: 86 },
  { name: "Diana", score: 95 },
];
